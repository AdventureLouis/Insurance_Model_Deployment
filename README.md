# Insurance_Model_Deployment
This repository is a project I decided to create out curiosity.All model building steps and deployments steps was done by Louis Adibe
In the front end,you need to input values for 3 variables BMI,New Smoker and age. For the New Smoker variable,you can either input "1" or "0"
<br>
New Smoker variable: 1-->represents smokers
                      <br>
                     0-->represents non smokers
<br>
The dataset and jupyter notebook for building the machine learning model can also be found in this repository

### How to run the App
In order to run the python flask in your terminal type "python app.py"

# Methodology
## Libraries
### Python libraries used:
Pandas(for data cleaning, data manipulation, and exploration),,Sklearn(for building regression and random forest model),Numpy(for evaluating model performance),
### Microsoft Office toolsÂ used:
Excel(Pre-data cleaning)
Powerpoint(for flowchart design)
### Backend framework used:
Flask(for web framework)
### Front-end framework used:
Bootstrap(Css&Html(for web layout styling and design)
### Azure resources used:
Azure resource group(container for holding related resources), Azure web apps(platform for building and hosting web applications)
### For continuous integration and deployments(CI/CD):
