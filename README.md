# Insurance_Model_Deployment
This repository is a project I decided to create out of curiosity.All model building steps and deployments steps was done by Louis Adibe
In the front end,you need to input values for 3 variables BMI,New Smoker and age. For the New Smoker variable,you can either input "1" or "0"
<br>
New Smoker variable: 1-->represents smokers
                      <br>
                     0-->represents non smokers
<br>
The dataset and jupyter notebook for building the machine learning model can also be found in this repository
